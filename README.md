## Variational Information Bottleneck for Semi-supervised Classification

### Abstract

In this paper we consider an information bottleneck (IB) framework for semi-supervised classification with several families of priors on latent space represen-
tation. We apply a variational decomposition of mutual information terms of IB. Using this decomposition we perform an analysis of several regularizers and
practically demonstrate an impact of different components of variational model on the classification accuracy. We propose a new formulation of semi-supervised
IB with hand crafted and learnable priors and link it to the previous methods such as semi-supervised versions of VAE (M1+M2) [1], AAE [2], CatGAN [3],
PixelGAN [4], etc.. We show that the resulting model allows better understand the role of various previously proposed regularizers in semi-supervised classi-
fication task in the light of IB framework. The proposed IB semi-supervised model with hand-crafted and learnable priors is experimentally validated on
MNIST under different amount of labeled data.
